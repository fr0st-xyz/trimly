## ❓ FAQ

### Why was Trimly created and why not use light-session?

**ChatGPT** gets slow after long conversations. After a while it starts lagging and it just feels heavy to use. That is the main reason **Trimly** exists.

As for light-session, it is a solid project, but some parts did not work the way I wanted them to. So I forked it and fixed those issues to make it work properly and feel smoother to use.


### Who is Trimly for?

- People who keep very long ChatGPT threads, like 100+ messages
- Developers who use ChatGPT for debugging, code reviews, or long refactors
- Anyone whose ChatGPT tab starts slowing down over time

### Do I collect your data?

No. I do not collect any data.

**Trimly** runs locally in your browser. It does not collect, store, or send any of your data anywhere. No tracking. No analytics. Nothing leaves your device.
