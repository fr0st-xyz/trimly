## 🤔 Why LightSession?

Long ChatGPT threads are brutal for the browser: the UI keeps every message in the DOM and the tab slowly turns into molasses — scroll becomes choppy, typing lags, devtools crawl.

**LightSession** fixes that by intercepting API responses and trimming conversation data *before* React renders it, keeping the actual conversation intact on OpenAI's side.

- **Fixes UI lag** in long chats
- **Keeps model context intact** (only the DOM is trimmed)
- **100% local** – no servers, no analytics, no tracking

Built after too many coding sessions where a single ChatGPT tab would start eating CPU and turn Firefox into a slideshow.

---

## 🎯 Who is this for?

- People who keep **very long ChatGPT threads** (100+ messages)
- Developers who use ChatGPT for **debugging, code reviews, or long refactors**
- Anyone whose ChatGPT tab becomes **sluggish after a while** in Firefox

---

## ✨ Features

**Performance**

- **Fetch Proxy** – intercepts API responses and trims JSON before React renders (no flash of untrimmed content)
- **Turn-based counting** – counts conversation turns (user→assistant), not individual nodes, for accurate message limits
- **Automatic trimming** – keeps only the last _N_ conversation turns visible (configurable range: 1–100)
- **Ultra Lean Mode** _(Experimental)_ – aggressive CSS optimizations: kills animations, applies containment

**User experience**

- **Configurable** – choose how many recent messages to keep (1–100)
- **Status indicator** – optional on-page pill showing trim statistics
- **Reversible** – refresh the page to restore the full conversation

**Privacy**

- **Zero network requests** – no data leaves your browser
- **Local settings only** – uses `browser.storage.local` for configuration
- **No telemetry** – no analytics, tracking, or usage reporting
- **Domain-scoped** – runs only on `chat.openai.com` and `chatgpt.com`

## 📦 Install

### Firefox Add-ons (recommended)

**[Install from AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lightsession-for-chatgpt/)**

After installation:

1. Open any ChatGPT conversation.
2. Click the LightSession icon in your Firefox toolbar.
3. Make sure the extension is **enabled**.
4. Adjust how many messages to keep if needed.

### Manual install (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/11me/light-session.git
cd light-session

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the extension
npm run build
```

Then:

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in Firefox.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select `extension/manifest.json`.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic usage

1. Open a long ChatGPT conversation (or create one).
2. Click the LightSession toolbar icon.
3. Ensure **Extension enabled** is checked. Trimming will now happen automatically.
4. Use the slider to choose how many of the most recent messages to keep (1–100).

When you want to see the full history again:

- Click **Refresh** in the popup, **or**
- Reload the ChatGPT page.

### Settings

- **Extension enabled** – master on/off toggle.
- **Keep last N messages** – how many messages remain visible in the DOM (1–100).
- **Show status bar** – display a floating pill with trim statistics.
- **Ultra Lean Mode** – aggressive performance mode for very long/laggy chats (experimental).
- **Refresh** – reloads the page to restore all messages.

### Keyboard accessibility

- Navigate controls with **Tab / Shift+Tab**.
- Toggle checkboxes and buttons with **Enter / Space**.
- Adjust the slider with **arrow keys**.

## ❓ FAQ

### Does this reduce the model's context?

No. LightSession only trims the **DOM** (what the browser renders), not the data stored by OpenAI.

- The conversation on OpenAI's servers remains intact.
- Reloading the page (or using **Refresh** in the popup) restores the full history.

### Is my data safe?

Yes:

- No external network requests are made by the extension.
- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry.
- Settings are stored locally in `browser.storage.local`.

### What happens if ChatGPT's UI changes?

LightSession uses a multi-tier selector strategy and conservative fallbacks, but a major UI redesign may temporarily break trimming. In that case:

- The extension will simply stop trimming (fail-safe).
- Your conversations will continue to work as usual.
- An update will be released to restore trimming behavior.

## 🔧 How it works

LightSession uses a **Fetch Proxy** architecture:

1. **Injection** – at `document_start`, injects a script into the page context before ChatGPT loads.
2. **Interception** – patches `window.fetch` to intercept `/backend-api/` JSON responses.
3. **Trimming** – parses the conversation mapping, counts turns (role transitions), keeps the last N turns.
4. **Response** – returns a modified Response with trimmed JSON; React renders only kept messages.

**Turn counting**: A "turn" is a contiguous sequence of messages from the same role. This matches how ChatGPT renders messages — multiple assistant nodes may render as a single bubble.

Trimming only affects what the browser renders. The conversation itself remains on OpenAI's side and is fully recoverable by reloading the page.

### Architecture

- **Fetch Proxy** – patches `window.fetch` in page context to intercept API responses
- **Turn-based trimming** – counts role transitions, not individual nodes
- **Content ↔ Page communication** – CustomEvents for settings dispatch and status updates
- **HIDDEN_ROLES** – system, tool, thinking nodes excluded from turn count
